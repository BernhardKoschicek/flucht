"During the First World War (1914-1918) refugees came from the theatres of war, "
"the border areas of the monarchy, into the interior of the Empire. More than "
"one million people were on the run. Residents of affected areas left their "
"homes and farms in order to flee from the war. For strategic reasons, numerous "
"villages were also evacuated by the Austro-Hungarian Army to use local "
"resources for itself or to destroy it in retreat from the advancing enemy. "

"The Austro-Hungarian Army also acted against its own multi-ethnic population. "
"Various groups of the population were purposefully expelled in order to prevent "
"them from real or alleged allying with the enemy states. Executions of "
"suspected were also carried out. On the Eastern front, Jews, Ruthenians "
"(Ukrainians living in Galicia and Bukovina) and Romanians were affected, among "
"the Christians especially the Orthodox population."

"The refugees were registered in overcrowded collection points and categorised "
"according to social status, material possessions, ethnicity and religion. The "
"aim of these measures was to manage and control the flow of refugees. The poor "
"population was transferred in freight wagons and under strict guard to their "
"assigned places of residence. Many of them died on the way from hunger, cold or "
"epidemics."

"In order to relieve the big cities of the monarchy, in which refugees had "
"already accumulated, it was decided in September 1914 to build barrack camps "
"for the destitute masses. These camps were erected along convenient railway "
"connections, but isolated from villages and towns. This was to prevent the "
"refugees from integrating and settling down in the long term, and in this way "
"the local population was not confronted with the true dimensions of the war. "
"Several such barrack camps were built in Lower Austria, the largest in Gmünd "
"accommodated up to 30,000 refugees, mostly Ruthenians."

"At the beginning of the refugee flow in 1914 huge wooden barracks were erected "
"in the camps. These were inexpensive, could be built quickly and used in many "
"ways, for example as dormitories, kitchens, schools or hospitals. Up to 500 "
"people were accommodated per barrack. "

"In the course of the war, smaller and smaller accommodations were used, as "
"diseases spread rapidly in the mass quarters. The poorly durable wooden "
"barracks, which were penetrated by cold and damp, were now joined by smaller "
"brick buildings and the camps were increasingly equipped with a modern "
"infrastructure."

"The camp in Oberhollabrunn was erected in 1916 and operated as a refugee camp "
"until spring 1918. Mainly Ruthenians and Romanians from Bukovina were kept "
"here, in whose homeland there was renewed mass flight and expulsion in the "
"summer of 1916 due to an advance by Tsarist Russia. The refugees in the camp "
"Oberhollabrunn belonged to the Christian, mainly Orthodox population of "
"Bukovina. In the spring of 1918, after the peace agreement with Soviet Russia "
"in Brest-Litowsk, they were sent back to their largely destroyed homeland."
