"During the First World War (1914-1918) refugees came from the theatres of"
" war, the border areas of the monarchy, into the interior of the Empire. "
"More than one million people were on the run. Residents of affected areas"
" left their homes and farms in order to flee from the war. For strategic "
"reasons, numerous villages were also evacuated by the Austro-Hungarian "
"Army to use local resources for itself or to destroy it in retreat from "
"the advancing enemy. "

"The Austro-Hungarian Army also acted against its own multi-ethnic "
"population. Various groups of the population were purposefully expelled "
"in order to prevent them from real or alleged allying with the enemy "
"states. Executions of suspected were also carried out. On the Eastern "
"front, Jews, Ruthenians (Ukrainians living in Galicia and Bukovina) and "
"Romanians were affected, among the Christians especially the Orthodox "
"population."

"The refugees were registered in overcrowded collection points and "
"categorised according to social status, material possessions, ethnicity "
"and religion. The aim of these measures was to manage and control the "
"flow of refugees. The poor population was transferred in freight wagons "
"and under strict guard to their assigned places of residence. Many of "
"them died on the way from hunger, cold or epidemics."

"In order to relieve the big cities of the monarchy, in which refugees had"
" already accumulated, it was decided in September 1914 to build barrack "
"camps for the destitute masses. These camps were erected along convenient"
" railway connections, but isolated from villages and towns. This was to "
"prevent the refugees from integrating and settling down in the long term,"
" and in this way the local population was not confronted with the true "
"dimensions of the war. Several such barrack camps were built in Lower "
"Austria, the largest in Gm√ºnd accommodated up to 30,000 refugees, mostly "
"Ruthenians."

"At the beginning of the refugee flow in 1914 huge wooden barracks were "
"erected in the camps. These were inexpensive, could be built quickly and "
"used in many ways, for example as dormitories, kitchens, schools or "
"hospitals. Up to 500 people were accommodated per barrack. "

"In the course of the war, smaller and smaller accommodations were used, "

"wooden barracks, which were penetrated by cold and damp, were now joined "
"by smaller brick buildings and the camps were increasingly equipped with "
"a modern infrastructure."

"The camp in Oberhollabrunn was erected in 1916 and operated as a refugee "
"camp until spring 1918. Mainly Ruthenians and Romanians from Bukovina "
"were kept here, in whose homeland there was renewed mass flight and "
"expulsion in the summer of 1916 due to an advance by Tsarist Russia. The "
"refugees in the camp Oberhollabrunn belonged to the Christian, mainly "
"Orthodox population of Bukovina. In the spring of 1918, after the peace "
"agreement with Soviet Russia in Brest-Litowsk, they were sent back to "
"their largely destroyed homeland."
